      <h3>Documenting My Documentation Journey</h3>

      <p>
          Documentation is something I’m very familiar with.  It was my first thought for a genre 
          tied to software engineering, aside from code itself.  Actually, if I’d tried to write 
          this Learning Package about the genre of code, it would probably have come out as mediocre 
          documentation.  Since it’s a resource many software engineers (including myself) consult 
          almost every day, the link between it and my discipline was very evident to me and made it 
          a natural choice for the focus of this assignment.

      </p>
      <p>
        To address and process documentation as a genre and its role in software engineering, I 
        decided to write a web article.  An article seemed like the logical next step, since 
        articles also come up if you search for some help with code.  The difference is that 
        documentation really breaks down a language or library into individual components and 
        presents them all for people to understand, whereas the articles are more process-driven.  
        For example, documentation would teach someone how to add an image to a webpage, but an 
        article might tell someone that the best images to include are SVG type images because they 
        don’t get pixelated.  Web articles tend to be more opinionated and persuasive, and therefore 
        can be more selective about what they include.  Documentation is just information, whereas 
        an article often must convince you that what it’s saying is right.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, I’m trying to convince my audience that documentation is a valuable resource for 
        them at any stage in their software engineering careers.  There’s a wide range of people I’m 
        aiming to reach in this article, from those figuring out how to write their first program to 
        people in high ranking positions at software companies.  I know it seems a little 
        presumptuous for me, not even a college graduate, to be telling executives what to do with 
        documentation.  However, I feel that since I’ve already worked multiple software engineering 
        jobs and had to go through onboarding at different companies, I’m more in tune with the 
        struggles of trying to understand a new repository and the team’s best practices (some 
        threshold concepts from way back when) than someone who has worked their way up to a high 
        level position at one company and is probably very comfortable with everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought I had a good idea of the range of familiarity my audience could have with these 
        concepts because, as I said, I have experience, but I’m still relatively new to software 
        engineering.  However, this was not the case.  I forgot how little knowledge I had at the 
        very beginning.  Luckily, my peer reviewer, Eliza, is unfamiliar with documentation and 
        therefore has the same experience level as the beginner end of the spectrum of my audience.  
        Her feedback helped me adjust my article to be easier for new programmers to understand.
      </p>

        While browsing documentation for the initial discussion post, I became much more aware of 
        the different styles that each source had.  There were common elements among all of them, 
        such as short sentences with simple vocabulary, but some, such as the python documentation, 
        were much more example heavy, while others, like the Java documentation, laid out the 
        functionality and expected the reader to understand it as-is (“Data Structures”, “Interface 
        Map”).  I also started to think more about the motivations behind writing documentation.  
        Before this exercise, I thought of documentation as something people just did, without any 
        particular reason.
      <p>
        In trying to process the documentation samples I collected with the frameworks and 
        commentary put forth from the readings, I gained a better appreciation for people who write 
        documentation and enable other people to learn how to code, or become better coders.  That’s 
        why Borg’s idea of “experts who perform gatekeeping roles” and that “novices must conform to 
        the expectations of the community in order to enter it” stuck out for me – part of it was 
        hugely applicable to software documentation, but part of it suggested that the writers’ 
        motivations were the opposite of what I understood them to be (Borg, 400).  Yes, if people 
        expect to become software engineers then they have to follow the rules put in place by the 
        creators of languages and libraries.  But the documenters of those rules (the writers of 
        documentation) are doing it to help people learn, not to exclude.  This follows the idea 
        from Devitt et al idea “many genres are designed within one specialist community for 
        functions to be filled by nonmembers of that community” (Devitt et al, 543).  However, 
        documentation counters their theme of genre being unhelpful to those outside of the 
        community – at least, it definitely does to me, since I wrote an article about how it’s the 
        opposite!  I also think that the discourse community defined by software documentation 
        “conceals the language … that take[s] place within it” since documentation is all about 
        defining and showcasing the language (Devitt et al, 541).
      </p>
      <p>
        My reflection for my first learning package was about how my expectations were almost 
        constantly defied with every new exercise I did in preparation.  I expected that to happen 
        again with this assignment, but instead, I gained a better understanding of a resource that 
        I’d taken for granted before.  I’m not saying I prefer one over the other.  I think both are 
        valuable, and to have experienced both in a class that isn’t even in my college is truly 
        amazing.
