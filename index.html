        One of the great things about being a software engineer is that you don’t need a lot to get 
        the job done.  A computer, a power source, and an internet connection are basically all you 
        need.  You can work almost anywhere – an office, your couch, a trendy café, you name it!  
        However, that means you won’t always have people around who can help you when you’re stuck.  
        When your program is breaking, what do you do?  Where can you find information to help you 
        diagnose and remedy the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out documentation!  In programming, documentation is information about how something 
        (ex. a language, library, etc.) works, or how to use it.  This information can be conveyed 
        through writing or images.  Here are some examples of documentation from a variety of 
        languages and libraries: 
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">React component methods</a>, 
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html">Python data structures</a>,
        <a href="https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/">centering in CSS</a>,
        <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/">Ruby gems</a>, and 
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Java Maps</a>.  
        If you haven’t heard of some of these and want to find out more, 
        their homepages will provide background information.  Each set of documentation has its 
        own style, but one thing is the same: if you’re not sure how to do something in a 
        particular language or library, consulting the relevant documentation is your best bet.  
        For example, you could be wondering how to make a list in Python.  In the Python 
        documentation from earlier, there is an example of a list being created:
        <code>fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana']</code>
        Now all you have to do is adapt this example to the list you want to make and type it into 
        your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve never met a developer who didn’t read documentation.  It’s online and free, so if you 
        have a computer and you’re connected to the internet, you can find it.  And since 
        developers use computers to write and run code, it’s very easily accessible.  Anyone can 
        look up documentation and learn how to do things using languages or libraries.  In fact, 
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/inspirational-success-stories-from-self-taught-web-developers-4f6f375cf17d/">many successful software engineers are self-taught</a>.  
        But everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, so just because anybody could be a 
        software engineer doesn’t mean everybody is one.  That, and I think a lot of people don’t 
        realize how easy it really is.

        This isn’t a “How to Read Documentation” article.  That wouldn’t make sense.  Documentation 
        should be easy to understand – you shouldn’t need documentation for documentation.  I trust 
        that you, if you can understand this, will understand well written (or even average) 
        documentation.  My goal for this article is that it teaches you how to leverage documentation 
        to suit your current situation as a developer.  Whether you’re the head of a large team 
        working on a corporate project or figuring out 
        <a href="https://learn.excelwithbusiness.com/blog/post/web-design/say-hello-world-in-28-different-programming-languages">Hello World</a>, 
        after reading this you’ll be armed with ways documentation can help you.  So, without 
        further ado, How to Make the Most of Documentation.
      </p>

      <h4>How to Make the Most of Documentation as a Beginner</h4>
      <p>
        So you’re just starting to write code.  Congratulations!  I’m not sure how you got here - 
        maybe a friend has been helping you, or you’ve been following a book - but I want to make sure 
        you know about the incredible amount of documentation available to you.
      <p>
        Documentation itself was defined earlier with some examples.  Your friend or your book is a 
        good start - I actually used to think I had to buy a book to learn how to write code!  A lot 
        of books are set up to walk you through a language or a mindset for programming, whereas 
        documentation might seem overwhelming for a beginner to just dive into, but it’s not!  All 
        (good) documentation has a balance of explanation and examples.  Too much explanation makes 
        things too theoretical and hard for a programmer to actually put into practice, and just 
        examples would have readers looking at the input and output and trying to guess what happened 
        in between.  Documentation also tends to use small words and simple sentence structures.  The 
        reader’s main focus should be understanding the code, not the plain English writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another good thing to know is that documentation builds on itself.  The explanations for more 
        advanced concepts assume you know what’s discussed in the lower ones, so if you ever come 
        across a documentation page that’s confusing and full of unfamiliar terms, chances are you 
        missed an intermediate concept.  Going back to the list example, 
        <code>'orange'</code> 
        is a String type object.  The list documentation assumes you know what a String is (it’s a 
        data type used to represent text).  If you don’t know something, searching Google for that 
        word or phrase, so “python string” in this case, would yield helpful results (likely more 
        documentation).  Some documentation sites even have their own search bars!
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, this article is about documentation, but it would be wrong for me to not at least 
        acknowledge forums.  In searching for answers about how to do something, you might come across 
        them (namely StackOverflow).  They can be helpful, especially when you have questions about a 
        specific situation, but there’s a chance the “Best Answer”, though best at the time, uses 
        things that are now deprecated.  I don’t want to scare you away from looking at forums - I use 
        them too! - but double checking with the documentation is a good idea.
      </p>

      <h4>How to Make the Most of Documentation When Working on Your Own Projects</h4>
      <p>
        Now that you’ve gotten a few programs under your belt, you want to start building your own 
        projects.  You’re likely familiar with the process of finding documentation and using it to 
        write new code or fix bugs in existing code, but have you tried documenting your own code?  
        You might be thinking, “I’m the only one who’s working on this.  I know what my code does, so 
        why should I need documentation?”  You’d be surprised how much you can forget, even if it’s 
        concerning code you wrote yourself.  As one of my coworkers says, “You’re not a real developer 
        until you find code that’s yours, but you don’t remember writing it.”
      <p>
        I’m not saying you should document every little thing.  If you name your functions and 
        variables well, you shouldn’t have to.  But for complex functions, or when you make a decision 
        about which things to display, for example, documenting your work will save you a lot of head 
        scratching in the future - maybe even a few “What was I thinking?”s.  And if you decide to 
        publish your work, for people to use or for potential employers to look at, having good 
        documentation in place will make things a lot easier for them.  Plus, they’ll see you really 
        know what you’re doing.
      </p>

      <h4>How to Make the Most of Documentation When Working on a Larger, High Level Team</h4>
      <p>
        Like the previous roles, members of a team working collectively on the same project can still 
        use language and library documentation to inform their own work.  Unless you have someone on 
        your team who’s practically a bible for the tools you’re using (and who has endless 
        availability), you and your teammates probably already do consult documentation.  But it 
        doesn’t have to stop there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have you ever looked at a piece of your own repository’s code and not known what it did?  Or 
        maybe you did know, but you didn’t understand why someone would chose to implement it that 
        way?  In those situations, you probably go to the author of that code and ask them.  If it was 
        a recent addition, they probably know, but there’s a good chance they forgot.  There’s also a 
        chance that the author is you, and if you don’t know, no one will be able to help you.  So how 
        do you fix this?
      </p>
      <p>
        You and your teammates start to document your work!  This documentation doesn’t have to be 
        accessible to the public - and if you’re working on a corporate project, it probably shouldn’t 
        be - but it should be available to the other members of your team. So if A writes a 
        complicated piece of code and documents it, B can just read the documentation instead of 
        asking A for an explanation, or worse, guessing what A’s code does.  It’ll save everyone time 
        working on their contributions to the project, and it’ll make onboarding new members of your 
        team so much easier.
      </p>

      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Everyone can participate in documentation, from people who’ve never written code in their life 
        to the CTOs of tech giants.  Many professions are difficult to learn on your own, but 
        documentation enables everyone to learn software development skills and participate in the 
        field.  And not only can you learn from documentation, you can also add to it and pay that 
        knowledge forward.  Now you have some ideas about how documentation can help you, so put them 
        into practice!
